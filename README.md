IOT based Thermal Signature detector with alarm & e-mail notification from passenger records including automatic Ticket checking, ambulance booking and Automatic Crowd Screening.


15000 INR --------------------> 1500 INR

no-man operation , IOT based , Deep learning Analysis State-of-the-art
This project is designed in a way to make it more cost effective and more intelligent than the now used Mannual Thermal Guns. And also filters and enforces law and order on potential patients with 100% accuracy making the job very much easier for the authourity staffs. It also books ambulance of from the nearby location.It also includes screening of crowd: if gathering is detected it sends real time video fit to police with location and image.

By an ultrasonic sensor after mesuring height of the passenger with the help of Servo motor the MLX-90614 sensor will be pointed right at the fore head of the passenger. AS SOON AS sensor array will detect a potential patient passing through our NOMAN operated door it promptly gets lockd and sets the whole station on alarm ; sends an email to the sequrity staffs with VISA details of the passenger and 
* Another mail to an Hospital with available slots nearby from our database with all the details of paitent ,for the ease of appointment. All from our database. 
* This setup also provides a customisable ticket checking process and app and web based interface for authourity uses.If there is no ambulance available just by one clik on button set on the above mentioned door and will book an ambulance from the nearest ambulance services.

#It also includes computer vision technology to detect crowd gathering via CCTV camera and automatically informs to police with real time video footage and picture.With app facility for taking vedio footage for crowd detection and complaint lodging.#

In todays condition, if 10 gates require 10 staffs with 15000 INR thermal guns at each exit point; our technology comes in with just 1 security staff for every 5 exit points ,with only a 2000 INR completely automated setup each.

                * For thats the beauty of IOT *
USP:-** Thermal Gun(15000 INR) +Ambulence booking+Screening of gathering+ Human labour evolved > Integrated IoT thermal dection(1500 INR)+AI NoMan operation,ID based notification, Cost effective *
